## Hi there 👋, I'm Patricia

I'm an ex-photojournalist 📸 that studied Photography and History of Arts🖼️🎨... that now is trying to learn all kind of new things (for me) in a Full Stack development Bootcamp with Factoria F5 (1100 hours) without loose my hair.

_ 💻 Skills on learning: 
 * HTML, CSS, JavaScript and GitHub.
