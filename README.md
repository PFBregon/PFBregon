## Hi there 👋, I'm Patricia.

I'm an ex-photojournalist 📸 that studied Photography and History of Arts 🖼️🎨... that now is trying to learn all kind of new things (for me) in a Full Stack Development Bootcamp with Factoria F5 (1100 hours).

_ 💻 Skills on learning: 
 * HTML, CSS, JavaScript and GitHub.

👩‍💻 You can find me, o learn more about at [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/patricia-fernández-bregón-a1565026) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/patriciabregon/)

PS.: If something in my code is wrong, maybe it's my cat's fault.
